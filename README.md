ABOUT
============================

This repository contains source code to learn node embeddings for dynamic 
networks.  It  also  contains  some  scripts  to evaluate the performances of the 
node embeddings on the tasks of node classification and edge prediction.

INSTALLATION


DOWNLOADING MISSING DATASETS
============================

Due to its size, we could not include the dataset Subreddit inside this
supplementary (however, all the other datasets are provided in this folder).
To download it, run the following command inside the same folder as this README:

wget https://snap.stanford.edu/data/soc-redditHyperlinks-body.tsv -P datasets/

To evaluate on the node classification task, you will also need FastText
pretrained word vectors. You can download them at the following URL:

https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/fasttext/vectors-wiki/wiki.en.zip

Then, extract the zip file and move the file "wiki.en.bin" inside the datasets/
directory of this folder.
